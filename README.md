### ✅ Final Notes:

- `## 🚀 Usage` is now a proper Markdown heading, so it will render as a **section title**.
- Code is wrapped in triple backticks (```) with a language (`ts` for TypeScript) for **syntax highlighting**.
- Everything is outside code blocks — no Markdown inside ` ``` ` — which was the issue earlier.

Let me know if you want to add:
- NPM badge
- GitHub repo link
- License info
- Or examples in plain JavaScript too.
